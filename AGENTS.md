# AGENTS.md

Last reviewed: 2026-08-25

Single source of truth for AI coding agents working in this repository. Other agent
entrypoints (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `QWEN.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
`.cursor/rules/`, `.windsurf/rules/`) are thin pointers back to this file.

> **Scriptorium** — project repo initialized from `project-seed-template`. Until
> bootstrap finishes, treat harness assets (prompts, policies, hooks, CI guidance,
> templates, inventories) as the working surface. Keep additions small, durable, and
> discoverable. Prefer [`prompts/bootstrap-project.md`](prompts/bootstrap-project.md)

## Operating principles

1. **Menu, not mandate.** Inventories list options; choose the minimal useful set per project.
2. **Thin entry, deep docs.** Keep this file short; push detail into linked docs.
3. **Interview before scaffolding.** Ask the user goals/constraints before writing many files.
4. **Verify, don't guess.** Prefer running tools and reading files over assuming.
5. **Policy as code where it pays.** Encode durable rules as checks with clear remediation.
6. **Temporary stays temporary.** Put scratch plans/research in `.context/` (gitignored).
7. **Protect remotes.** Push only to this project's `origin` (`kgrizz-git/scriptorium`),
   never to `project-seed-template`.
8. **Clean up after completion.** Remove completed TODOs from the active queue (do not use
   `to_do.md` as history), log every meaningful completion once in the appropriate durable log,
   and skip logging only truly trivial edits,
   archive completed plans under `plans/archive/completed/`, move superseded/abandoned plans
   to `plans/archive/superseded/`, park postponed work in `plans/deferred/`, and clean scratch
   files. See [`policies/plans-and-todos.md`](policies/plans-and-todos.md),
   [`plans/README.md`](plans/README.md), and [`prompts/cleanup-completed-work.md`](prompts/cleanup-completed-work.md).
9. **Backlog discipline.** [`to_do.md`](to_do.md) is the agent-visible queue: start at **Next Up**
   (3–5 plan pointers, not checklists). Every active `plans/*.md` file has an **Active plans**
   row; completing or archiving a plan updates `to_do.md` in the same change. Detail stays in
   plans; Icebox holds deferred/someday pointers.
10. **Recommendations stand on their own.** A reader without access to any external source
   should still be able to act on what a file says. Referencing private or personal repos is
   encouraged — cite them by `repo → path` and mark them private; an agent that *does* have
   access should go read them. Just don't let the advice become unusable without them.
11. **Progress is written down, not remembered.** Multi-phase work records state in `.context/`
    as it goes. A session that ends mid-task leaves a `Next action`, not a gap.

## Agent tooling policy

Rule lives in [`policies/agent-tooling-contract.md`](policies/agent-tooling-contract.md); this is a summary.

- Search and read targeted files before requesting broad repository context.
- Use **one** primary code-intelligence/indexing tool per role or task.
- Prefer a CLI plus task-specific skill for batch work; use MCP only when persistent,
  interactive state materially helps.
- Record decisions, changed files, verification, and next steps in a handoff before
  changing agents or IDEs.
- Keep credentials, generated indexes, and local agent state out of version control
  (`.agent-state/` is gitignored; rebuildable by definition).
- Smoke-test a tool before adopting it: index a fixture, run one query, tear down
  (see the contract for the shape).

## Repo map

- `prompts/` — reusable prompts (bootstrap, refactor, docs audit, subagent workflow, reviews).
- `prompts/bootstrap/` — per-topic decision cards (ask → branch → produce → done when) for the
  bootstrap phases that have a real branch.
- `templates/` — fill-in artifacts (briefs, plans, designs, ADRs, runbooks, releases, reviews, assessments).
- `policies/` — durable repo rules (file size/counts, plans/todos, changelogs, doc freshness, commits, security).
- `hooks/` — pre-commit config + policy-check scripts (file size, TODO limits, secrets, lint).
- `ci/` — CI selection guidance and example workflows.
- `inventory/` — curated indexes of tools, skills, MCP servers, references (install-on-demand).
- `docs/` — navigation helpers and quick-reference guides (`book-format.md` / schema).
- `src-tauri/` — Tauri 2 Rust host (`book_format` types + schema-bind tests).
- `src/` — Vite + React + TypeScript frontend shell.
- `scripts/` — automation scripts (setup, health check, environment validation,
  `generate-fixture-book.py`).
- `tests/` — Python tests; `tests/fixtures/` documents how to regenerate book fixtures
  into gitignored `tmp/fixtures/`.
- `plans/` — **active** implementation plans and the living roadmap. Layout:
  - `plans/deferred/` — postponed plans (not abandoned)
  - `plans/archive/completed/` — finished plans
  - `plans/archive/superseded/` — replaced or abandoned plans
  See [`plans/README.md`](plans/README.md) and [`policies/plans-and-todos.md`](policies/plans-and-todos.md).
- `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/` — editor rule sets (CodeGuard security rules).
- `.devin/` — Devin CLI configuration and project-specific skills.
- `.context/` — scratch only; never required reading, never committed.
- `assessments/` — timestamped **durable** reviews (security, QI) when the user asks to keep them in-repo; do not rewrite in place. **Plan reviews default to gitignored `tmp/` and must not be linked from tracked docs** (see [`tmp/README.md`](tmp/README.md)).

**Notes_and_Ideas vs this template:** personal research dumps, private key dashboards, and
exploratory idea notes belong in a Notes_and_Ideas (or similar) repo. Index only durable,
reusable menus and conventions here.

## Agent compatibility

This file follows the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) convention and is read (directly or via
a thin pointer) by Claude Code, OpenAI Codex/GPT, Cursor, Gemini/Antigravity, Qwen, DeepSeek,
MiniMax, opencode, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot. When adding tool-specific behavior, keep the
durable rule here and let the per-tool file point to it.
