Status: draft

Depends on:
- [`archive/completed/2026-08-23-m0-tauri-foundation.md`](archive/completed/2026-08-23-m0-tauri-foundation.md) **complete**
- [`2026-08-23-pre-m1-flipbook-spike.md`](2026-08-23-pre-m1-flipbook-spike.md) **complete** (ADR gates G1–G5)
Follows: product roadmap M1

## Goal

Deliver the **first usable product slice**: open a folder of scanned page images → create a
**book package** → **page-turn** through faithful page images (no stretch) with persisted
last-read page. Priorities: reliability and correctness over polish.

## Out of scope

- OCR / search / text layer (M2)
- Text / hybrid reader modes (M3–M4)
- Multi-book shelf UI (M5) — reopen package is enough
- Hotspot authoring (M6)
- Deep-zoom, figure extraction, heavy texture (M7) — except whatever the flip ADR already chose
- Web/PWA / IIIF (M8)
- Referenced/symlink storage mode (schema-reserved only)
- HEIC (document unsupported)

## Approach

**Image-first reader** using the **library chosen in the pre-M1 ADR** (not assumed StPageFlip).
Ingest per M0 decisions: natural-sort → **atomic copy** into app-data `books/<id>/` with
**relative paths only** in `meta.json`. Resolve to absolute paths only in Rust at load time for
`convertFileSrc`.

**UX:** single **Open…** action that inspects the chosen folder — if `meta.json` present, load
book; else treat as scan folder and ingest (confirm dialog before copy). Avoid two near-identical
folder pickers.

**No silent non-flip fallback.** If the ADR library fails in integration, stop and escalate.

### Alternatives considered

| Option | Why not |
|---|---|
| PDF-only ingest | Product is folder-of-scans |
| Dual Open folder / Open book pickers | Confusing; use inspect-and-branch |
| `<img>` strip if flip fails | Deletes the product metaphor |
| Defer lazy-load always to M7 | Only if perf budget met; else windowed load is **in** M1 |

## Acceptance criteria (binary)

| ID | Criterion | How verified |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Ingest of a fixture folder produces a package that **validates** against `docs/book-format.schema.json` | `cargo test` + schema validation |
| A2 | Page order matches the **natural-sort table** below for the committed sort fixture | `cargo test` |
| A3 | Each defined error variant returns its required user-visible message and does not abort the process | `cargo test` (+ manual spot-check in UI) |
| A4 | Reader shows **page-turn** for ≥2 pages using ADR library; images are scan files (not placeholders); **no aspect stretch** (pad policy from ADR) | Manual + spike gates carried forward |
| A5 | Keys: **←/→** and on-screen prev/next; at last page next is no-op; at first page prev is no-op | Manual script |
| A6 | `lastReadPage` persists across quit/relaunch for the same book **`id`** (not filesystem path); progress flush on window close (not only debounced flip) | Manual script |
| A7 | Open… on an existing package directory loads without re-copy | Manual script |
| A8 | Unsupported `formatVersion` → `SchemaVersionUnsupported` message | `cargo test` |
| A9 | Perf budget (below) holds on the **named reference class** against the **pinned gate corpus** | Manual timed run; record results in PR |
| A10 | Mutating one page byte causes `ChecksumMismatch` on load (negative checksum test) | `cargo test` |
| A11 | Ingest rejects `id` that case-folds equal to an existing book directory on case-insensitive FS | `cargo test` |
| A12 | Resolved page path canonicalizes under package root (prefix assertion after `join`) | `cargo test` |
| A13 | Webview CSP is **not** `null` before Phase 2 commands + asset protocol ship | Review `tauri.conf.json` + manual |

### Error taxonomy (Rust enum → user message)

| Variant | When | Message must convey |
|---|---|---|
| `EmptyFolder` | No files | Folder has no files |
| `NoSupportedImages` | No jpg/jpeg/png/webp | No supported images found |
| `UnreadableFile` | I/O error on a page | Which file failed |
| `DestinationExists` | Target book path exists (incl. case-insensitive `id` collision on macOS/Windows) | Refuse overwrite |
| `DuplicatePageStem` | Two sources map to same stem (incl. case-insensitive) | Duplicate page names |
| `InsufficientDiskSpace` | Pre-flight fail | Need more free space |
| `SchemaVersionUnsupported` | Unknown/newer formatVersion | Unsupported book version |
| `InvalidPackage` | missing meta / schema fail | Not a valid Scriptorium book |
| `ChecksumMismatch` | Page bytes ≠ stored sha256 | Book files corrupted or modified |
| `PermissionDenied` | OS denied | Permission denied |

### Natural-sort specification (normative for M1)

Sort **filename stem** with natural order (numeric chunks as integers), case-insensitive
extension ignored for ordering. Only `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.png` `.webp` included.

**Tie-break (normative):** after natural compare of stems is equal, order by:
1. Longer zero-padded numeric representation wins for that chunk only when integer values
   are equal but digit strings differ (`001` before `01` before `1` — longer pad first).
2. Else lexicographic compare of the full stem as UTF-8 bytes (stable, locale-independent).
3. Else original path string as UTF-8 bytes.

| Input filenames (unordered) | Expected order |
|---|---|
| `2.jpg`, `10.jpg`, `1.jpg` | `1`, `2`, `10` |
| `page-2.PNG`, `page-10.png`, `page-1.png` | `page-1`, `page-2`, `page-10` |
| `img01.jpg`, `img001.jpg` | `img001`, `img01` (longer pad first per rule 1) |
| `cover.jpg`, `1.jpg`, `2.jpg` | `1`, `2`, `cover` (letters after pure-numeric stems that sort as numbers first — pure numeric stems ordered by value; non-numeric follow by UTF-8) |
| `1.jpg`, `1b.jpg`, `1a.jpg` | `1`, `1a`, `1b` |

Expand to ≥12 cases in `cargo test` beside the sort function. Do not leave tie-breaks as open questions.

### Performance budget (M1)

**Reference machine class (named up front):** Apple Silicon Mac (M-series), **16 GB RAM**,
development build via `pnpm tauri dev` (or release build if noted). If developing primarily
on another class, amend this plan before claiming A9.

**Gate corpus (pinned):** generated script output — **200 pages**, average **~5 MB** JPEG each
(total ~1 GB ±10%). The 2–8 MB range is for smoke only, not the gate.

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| Open to first interactive flip | ≤ 15 s | Wall clock from Open confirm → first successful flip gesture |
| Steady-state RSS after open | ≤ 2 GB | Sample process RSS 30 s after first flip (Activity Monitor / `ps`) |
| Flip animation | ≥ 30 fps average over 10 flips | `requestAnimationFrame` deltas while flipping; log mean fps |

If targets fail without lazy/windowed loading, **implement windowed page load in M1**. Soft-warn at **500** pages; no hard cap unless ADR says so.

## Tauri asset-protocol checklist (required before reader Phase)

- [ ] `app.security.assetProtocol.enable: true`
- [ ] **Replace `security.csp: null`** with an explicit CSP before Phase 2 (see A13)
- [ ] `assetProtocol.scope.allow` covers app-data `books/**` (app-wide scope ≠ fs capability)
- [ ] CSP allows `img-src` (and media if needed) for `asset:` and `https://asset.localhost`
- [ ] `convertFileSrc` only given **absolute** paths (Rust resolves relative → absolute)
- [ ] After `package_root.join(file)`, canonicalize and assert result is under `package_root` (A12)
- [ ] macOS: account for `/var` → `/private/var` canonicalization in scopes
- [ ] Windows: verify `https://asset.localhost` form
- [ ] Persisted-scope plugin **not** required for app-data default; revisit if library root changes

## Proposed file changes

```
src-tauri/src/book/     — sort, create (atomic copy), load, validate, progress, errors
src/features/reader/    — FlipbookView per ADR
src/features/home/      — Open… inspect-and-branch
src/lib/bookTypes.ts
docs/manual-test-m1.md  — step script + fixtures
scripts/generate-fixture-book.*  — small + large corpora → tmp/
```

## Phases & checklist

### Phase 0 — Integration gate (ADR already done)

- [ ] Confirm ADR library still loads in current shell
- [ ] Complete asset-protocol checklist above (macOS required; Windows if available)
- [ ] Stop if G1–G5 from spike no longer hold

### Phase 1 — Book I/O (Rust)

- [ ] Natural sort + table tests
- [ ] Atomic create_book_from_folder + free-space check + DestinationExists
- [ ] Per-page width/height/sha256/byteSize written
- [ ] load_book + schema validation
- [ ] lastReadPage read/write keyed by book **`id`**; flush API for window close
- [ ] load_book re-verifies per-page sha256 (negative test: A10)
- [ ] load_book canonical path prefix check (A12)
- [ ] Ingest case-insensitive `id` collision check (A11)
- [ ] Orphan temp-dir sweep + DuplicatePageStem tests
- [ ] All error taxonomy variants tested with `tempfile`
- [ ] Schema bind: Rust sample serialize ↔ `docs/book-format.schema.json`

### Phase 2 — Commands + UI

- [ ] Replace `security.csp: null` with production CSP (A13) before exposing commands/asset URLs
- [ ] Commands + capabilities for dialog + app-data fs + asset scope
- [ ] Open… inspect-and-branch + confirm before ingest copy
- [ ] Map errors to dialogs/toasts
- [ ] Vitest (or equivalent) for pure TS helpers (URL resolve / UI state) — required, not optional

### Phase 3 — Reader

- [ ] ADR flip library bound to page list
- [ ] ←/→ + on-screen controls; edge no-ops
- [ ] Debounced progress + **flush on close**
- [ ] Loading / empty states

### Phase 4 — Docs & release

- [ ] `docs/manual-test-m1.md` + README try-it
- [ ] `VERSION` → **0.2.0**; `CHANGELOG.md` user-facing
- [ ] Update roadmap / `to_do.md`; archive this plan when verified

## Verification

- [ ] All acceptance IDs A1–A9 checked
- [ ] `cargo test` / `clippy` / `fmt` green in CI
- [ ] Manual script executed once on reference machine; results noted in PR or README
- [ ] No absolute user home paths in committed fixtures or sample `meta.json`

## Open questions

- [ ] Single vs spread layout: follow ADR / library defaults

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADR library still painful in product UI | med | high | Phase 0 gate; escalate — no strip fallback |
| Large books OOM | med | high | Budget A9; windowed load if needed |
| Schema drift TS/Rust | med | med | JSON Schema + Rust serialize-and-validate test (M0/M1) |

## Follow-ups from M0 senior reviews (2026-08-25)

Before-M1 items (**S1**, **S2**, **S3**, **S5**) landed on the M0 branch. Critical re-review
(**#3**) added **A10–A13** (checksum negative test, case-fold `id`, path prefix, CSP). M0 branch
also landed **S6** (`deny_unknown_fields`), expanded negative/index tests, slug lockstep tests,
and **D2** annotations wording.

Remaining findings to address during M1 (ingest/load) or harness work:

| ID | Item | Home |
|---|---|---|
| S4 | Decide: enforce RFC 3339 for `createdAt`/`updatedAt` in `BookMeta::validate`, or drop the ISO claim from docs | M1 ingest validation |
| S7 | Fixture round-trip Rust test: unique tempdir + document `python3` dependency | M1 or next Rust touch |
| S8 | ~~Table-driven negative tests~~ — largely done on M0 branch; extend if new variants appear | M1 |
| S12 | Drop redundant `cargo check` after clippy+test (or comment why); clear stale pages on fixture regenerate | M1 / next CI touch |
| C3 | `load_book` must verify page bytes vs `sha256` — pinned as **A10** | M1 Phase 1 |
| SEC2 | Case-insensitive `id` directory collision — pinned as **A11** | M1 Phase 1 |
| SEC3 | Canonical path must stay under package root — pinned as **A12** | M1 Phase 1 |
| SEC4 | `csp: null` must be replaced — pinned as **A13** | M1 Phase 2 |

Harness/docs (not M1 product):

| ID | Item | Home |
|---|---|---|
| S9 | Archived M0 plan checklist still unticked; roadmap “app-data library root” is a decision, not delivered code | M0.5 / docs hygiene |
| S10 | README hedge; centralize or test slug regex triplication (Rust/Python/schema lockstep tests now exist) | M0.5 |
| S11 | `tsc -b` for project references; ESLint/Prettier for TS | [roadmap M0.5](2026-08-23-product-roadmap.md#m05--harness-follow-ups-after-tauri-scaffold--when-app-code-exists) |
