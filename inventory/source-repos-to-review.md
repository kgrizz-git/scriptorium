# Source Repositories To Review

Last reviewed: 2026-08-11

Repos worth inspecting for reusable skills, prompts, conventions, tools, or architecture
ideas. This is a starting list — add entries as you discover new candidates.

Entries marked *(private)* are the maintainer's own repos, where new tools are first catalogued
and evaluated before durable findings are distilled into this template. **An agent with access
should read them directly** — they are more current than the summaries here. Everything in this
template is still actionable without them.

## Curated starting list

| Repo | Why useful |
|---|---|
| `kgrizz-git/Notes_and_Ideas` *(private)* | **The richest tool catalog feeding this template — check it first.** Ongoing curated notes on AI/ML tooling, coding-agent harnesses, MCP servers, model providers and pricing, context-engineering and token-efficiency research, plus ~15 subagents and ~60 skills (scientific, engineering, writing, dev). Useful entry points: `reference/tools/`, `reference/agents/`, `info/`, `agents_and_skills/`. Findings are distilled here as they mature — see `inventory/catalog-skills-agents.md` and `inventory/agent-tooling-efficiency.md`. |

## Review checklist

For each source repo:

- What reusable skills, prompts, rules, or scripts does it contain?
- Which conventions are project-specific and should not be copied?
- Are there useful CI, security, testing, docs, or release patterns?
- Are there licensing or attribution constraints?
- Is the repo actively maintained? (last commit, open issues, stars)
- What small adaptation, if any, should be added to this project?
