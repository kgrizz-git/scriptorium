# Inventory

Last reviewed: 2026-08-23

A curated index of tools, skills, MCP servers, libraries, cloud services, and source
repositories that may help an AI agent scaffold or improve a project.

The inventory is **not a checklist** to install everything. Use it as a menu:

1. Read this file.
2. Open only topic files relevant to the project.
3. Ask the user about additional repos, tools, org standards, or constraints.
4. Choose a minimal useful set.
5. Explain why each selected item fits.

**Scope:** durable, reusable menus live here. Personal bookmarks, private API-key
dashboards, and exploratory research notes belong in a Notes_and_Ideas (or similar)
repo — not committed into this template. Cite those repos freely as sources (mark them
*(private)* and use `repo → path`); just make sure each entry is still actionable on its own.

**Staleness:** tool facts rot faster than prose. `Last reviewed:` (180 days,
[`policies/doc-freshness.md`](../policies/doc-freshness.md)) asserts the text is accurate;
`Catalog reviewed through:` (120 days, opt-in) asserts the *menu* is still the right one.
Run [`ci/scripts/check_doc_links.py`](../ci/scripts/check_doc_links.py) to find dead
links and renamed projects — evidence a tool needs re-evaluating.
