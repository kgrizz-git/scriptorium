# Skills & Agents Catalog (Install-On-Demand)

Last reviewed: 2026-07-11

An index of agent skills and subagent definitions available to install when a project
needs them. Nothing here is vendored into this template — this is a menu, not a
pre-install list.

**How to use:** Find the skill or agent that fits the task, follow the source link,
copy the folder into `.claude/skills/<name>/` or `.claude/agents/<name>.md`, then verify
it loads correctly in your IDE.

Before installing or invoking skills, use [`prompts/select-agent-skills.md`](../prompts/select-agent-skills.md)
to choose the smallest useful set. When installed in a project created from this template,
planner/orchestrator/coder/reviewer/tester/secops/ux skills should prefer local prompts,
templates, and policies when those files exist.

## Notes_and_Ideas collection (kgrizz-git)

Source: `kgrizz-git/Notes_and_Ideas` → `agents_and_skills/` *(private repo)*. **If you have
access, read it directly — it is more current and more detailed than this summary.** The
tables below are a distillation, kept usable on their own for anyone who does not.

A personal collection of subagents and skills developed for scientific, engineering,
writing, and product workflows. Maintained alongside Cursor's `.claude/` directory; use
`rsync -a agents_and_skills/agents/ .claude/agents/` to install (see the
`agents_and_skills/README.md` for full sync instructions).

> **Trust level:** Personal/internal. Review before adopting; skip anything project-specific
> or idea-placeholder.

### Subagents (`agents_and_skills/agents/`)

| Agent | Purpose | When to install |
|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator` | Hub agent; reads `plans/orchestration-state.md`, delegates, approves git/cloud proposals, manages iteration guards | Any project using hub-and-spoke multi-agent workflow |
| `planner` | Writes phased `[ ]` checklist plans with task graphs and gates under `plans/` only | When you want a dedicated planning agent separate from coder |
| `coder` | Implements plans; updates plan checkboxes; proposes git branch/cloud batch via HANDOFF | Core engineering agent for most projects |
| `debugger` | Isolates bugs; does not fix production code speculatively; returns root-cause analysis | When you want bug investigation separated from fixes |
| `reviewer` | Spec-vs-implementation review; lint check; merge recommendation; plan checklist sync | Code and design review gate |
| `tester` | Runs tests; maintains `logs/test-ledger.md`; **does not** edit tests to force passing | Test execution + failure triage without silent fixes |
| `secops` | Security scans; timestamped reports in `assessments/`; may request cloud for heavy scans | Security audit gate |
| `ux` | UX/UI assessment; Playwright + screenshots; accessibility patterns; structured HANDOFF | Any UI-bearing project |
| `docreviewer` | Writes `logs/docs_log-*.md`; does not touch product source | Documentation review gate |
| `docwriter` | Edits documentation files; suggests docreviewer after | Dedicated doc writing |
| `researcher` | Research tasks with structured notes and bibliography suggestions; `readonly` mode | Literature or technical research tasks |
| `math-physics-deriver` | Line-by-line math/physics derivations with explicit notation, assumptions, and equation provenance | Scientific computing, physics, signal processing |
| `math-physics-challenger` | Adversarially reviews derivations; challenges assumptions; returns accept/revision verdicts | Paired with deriver in quality-gate workflow |
| `simulation-setup-runner` | Sets up and runs FDTD, FEM, Monte Carlo, and radiation-transport simulations | Simulation-heavy projects |
| `simulation-verifier-interpreter` | V&V, uncertainty analysis, and interpretation for simulation outputs | Paired with setup-runner in quality-gate workflow |

### Installing an always-on rule

Some of these agents assume an always-on routing rule — for the hub-and-spoke set, the
orchestrator reads `NEXT_TASK_TOOL:` / `NEXT_TASK_TOOL_SECOND:` lines from each subagent
response and dispatches the next one (`.claude/rules/orchestration-auto-chain.md` in the
source repo). Any rule that must apply to every turn installs the same way:

| IDE | What to do |
|---|---|
| Cursor | Copy to `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc` (frontmatter: `alwaysApply: true`) |
| Claude Code | Append the minimal block to `CLAUDE.md` |
| VS Code Copilot | Append the minimal block to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |

## K-Dense-AI / claude-scientific-skills

Source: https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills

A large library of `SKILL.md`-style packages covering scientific research, data analysis,
domain engineering, and academic writing — organized as Cursor-compatible skill folders.

> **Trust level:** Publicly maintained; MIT license. Review before vendoring; some skills
> may target specific toolchain versions.

**Installation options:**
- Vendor a subset: copy selected skill folders into `agents_and_skills/skills/<name>/`
- Submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills`
  then symlink or copy chosen skills into `.claude/skills/`
- Sparse checkout: pull only the skill folders you need

Match Cursor's layout: each skill must be a directory with `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter
`name` + `description` required). Normalize if upstream uses a different structure.

Notable categories in the repo (browse the README for the full list):
- Scientific computing (numpy, scipy, pandas, xarray, JAX)
- Bioinformatics (BLAST, Biopython, AlphaFold, PyMOL)
- Chemistry (RDKit, OpenBabel, ASE, VASP)
- Physics simulation (LAMMPS, GROMACS, Quantum ESPRESSO)
- Data analysis and ML (sklearn, PyTorch, Hugging Face)
- Academic writing and LaTeX

### Pantheon (K-Dense) — multi-persona brainstorming
https://pantheon.k-dense.ai/

Free hosted tool: ask one science/research question and get ~80 AI personas answering
in parallel (philosophers, scientists, founders, ML researchers), with cited web sources
and a consensus synthesis. Built on K-Dense Mimeographs; replies are style-transfers, not
quotations from real people. **Use for brainstorming and framing**, not as a sole
authority. Complements in-repo skills such as `scientific-brainstorming` /
`consciousness-council` (Notes_and_Ideas) when you want a quick external panel.

Also listed under `inventory/tools-index.md` → Research tools.

## Official Anthropic / Claude Code

Source: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code — official documentation only.

### Built-in slash commands (no install needed)
Claude Code ships with built-in commands accessible via `/help`. Key built-ins relevant
to repo harness work:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/init` | Creates a CLAUDE.md from the current repo |
| `/clear` | Clears conversation context |
| `/compact` | Summarizes conversation to free context |
| `/memory` | Shows/edits project memory |
| `/cost` | Shows token usage |
| `/mcp` | Lists active MCP server connections |

### Official skill/agent patterns
Anthropic documents several agent skill patterns in the Claude Code docs:
- Hook-based automation (pre-tool, post-tool, notification, stop hooks)
- MCP server integration for custom tools
- Subagent spawning via the Agent tool (Explore, code-reviewer agent types)
- Session-persistent memory via CLAUDE.md and `.claude/` directory

No separately installable official "skill package" exists from Anthropic as of the
knowledge cutoff — all official guidance lives in the docs.

## Selection checklist

Before installing any skill or agent:

- [ ] Source is from an official/verified provider or you've reviewed the code
- [ ] License permits use in your project type
- [ ] The skill is focused enough that agents can find and apply it reliably
- [ ] `SKILL.md` has valid YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
- [ ] Description uses third-person language with concrete trigger phrases
- [ ] No hardcoded personal paths, credentials, or project-specific assumptions
- [ ] You've tested it in isolation before adding to automated chains
