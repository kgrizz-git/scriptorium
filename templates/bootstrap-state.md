# Template: Bootstrap State

Last reviewed: 2026-08-23

Copy to `.context/bootstrap-state.md` at the start of Phase 0 and update it **as each phase
completes**, not at the end. `.context/` is gitignored, so this never ships with the project.

This file is the reason bootstrap survives a context reset, an interrupted session, or a
handoff to a different agent. Without it, a resumed session has no way to know it stopped at P4.
Status values: `pending` | `in-progress` | `done` | `skipped — <reason>`.

## Decisions

<!-- One line per decision that a later phase or a future session depends on. -->

- Data classification: 
- Approval owner (if confidential): 
- Required CI check names (P4 → consumed by P3): 
- Orchestration tier: 
- Agent tooling adopted / rejected: 

## Open questions

- 

## Next action

<!-- The single next step, so a resumed session starts here instead of re-deriving. -->
- 
```

## Rules

- Write `skipped — <reason>` rather than leaving a phase `pending`. Silent skips are the failure
  mode this file exists to prevent.
- Update **Next action** before ending any session mid-bootstrap.
- P3 consumes the required-check names decided in P4 — record them when decided, not later.
- Verify claims with `scripts/check-bootstrap.sh`; it checks repo evidence, not this file.
  If they disagree, the repo is right.
- Once P8 is `done`, the file's job is over. Fold anything durable into
  `.context/project-profile.md` and let cleanup remove it
  ([`../policies/plans-and-todos.md`](../policies/plans-and-todos.md)).
