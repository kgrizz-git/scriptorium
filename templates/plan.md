## Completion steps (when status = complete)

When this plan is complete, follow this workflow:

1. **Update plan status** to `complete` or `abandoned`
2. **Move this file** to `plans/archive/completed/` (or `plans/archive/superseded/` if abandoned;
   `plans/deferred/` if postponed). See [`../plans/README.md`](../plans/README.md).
3. **Log completion** in appropriate changelog:
   - User-visible changes → `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Internal/harness changes → `CHANGELOG.dev.md`
   - Maintenance/security → `MAINTENANCE.md`
4. **Remove related items from `to_do.md`**
5. **Clean up `.context/` scratch files** (archive or delete)
6. **Update `orchestration-state.md`** if present (set phase to `complete`/`blocked`)
7. **Reference the completion** with links to related commits/PRs

Use [`prompts/cleanup-completed-work.md`](../prompts/cleanup-completed-work.md) for systematic cleanup.
